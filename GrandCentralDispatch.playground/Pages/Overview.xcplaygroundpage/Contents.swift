 ## Grand Central Dispatch
 <aka GCD or [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch)>
 
 ### Dispatch <verb>
 * Send off to a destination or for a purpose.
 * Deal with (a task, problem, or opponent) quickly and efficiently.

 ### Fundamental Concepts:
 * Threads
 * Queues
 * Passing Functions/Closures
 
 ### Remarks
 * We will be looking at the swift 3 version of the GCD api. The documentation has not yet (01/17/17) caught up.
 * The more that I work with GCD the more I realize how much there is to understand. Indications (ex. the order of print statements) can be deceiving. I encountered some surprises on the Concurrency and Quality of Service pages.
